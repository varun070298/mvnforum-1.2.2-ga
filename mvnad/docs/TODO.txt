                   mvnAd Todo List
-------------------------------------------------------

Last update on: $Date: 2010/08/18 03:24:16 $

Note:
- After clean all projects, build mvnad -> causes error

[XuanTL]
- when show ads in first post,... -> not show border -> I don't know how to fix it

- http://10.0.0.120:8080/mvncms/adadmin/configforum
    layout of this page is not good

Error: document.getElementById("z3_1213246554765") has no properties
Source File: http://localhost:8080/mvnforum_enterprise/delivery/getad?zoneID=3
Line: 8   
   
- Bug: when not update the country, we should not show it in the chart
   suggestion: we could change the DAO not to select the empty country
- Make sure when click button, the button is disabled
- Make sure we cannot link more than xxx number of banner (check value of ZoneMaxBanner)
- Validate all input when add/edit banner, add/edit zone (for example, the Banner width must be > 0, Zone Cell Count must be >= 1, etc)   
- mvnCMS also have Chart for Ads, check if it is the same, then we need to remove the one in mvnCMS
   : need to check to make sure all reference in CMS are deleted
- Synch login page with login page of mvnForum
   explain: the login.jsp in mvnForum is support external database, so we need to synch this feature to mvnAd
- Add permission to use HTML Ads (because this could cause cross site script)
- Add permission to view Chart
- http://localhost:8080/javavn/adadmin/listzones?offset=10
   then edit
   after edit, it jump to 
   http://localhost:8080/javavn/adadmin/listzones
   ===>>> we should remember the offset (as in mvnforum)
- Write BannerCache and use it in method 
     DeliveryHandler.processClickAd
     EnterpriseDeliveryHandler.processClickAd 
- Make sure with image banner running in direct mode, the view count and click count is correct
- List of files should order by name
- Write page to manage the banner of any user
- Consider config module pattern in the web.xml (as a param of Servlet)
- Review if deleteSpareRecords work with other databases or not  
- BannerDAO.getBannersOfUser : should combine to other method
- getDistinctMemberNamesHasBanner : check if this method should return Collection of memberName, not memberBean

- Support detect browser Konqueror
- http://localhost:8080/javavn2/adadmin/addbanner : show wrongly with Konqueror
- ad in mvnforum: should support 
  * Support one more line in the footer for ads of mvnForum
  * add banner for page search (search the post in mvnforum)
- Direct Code and Auto Reload : do they conflict or not ?
- when link a banner with zone, the association is expired but it is still show the expire status of banner (Running)
- if the zone type is direct code, then the width and height is not effect 
- addbanner: if user enter the url of image, we should also show preview of it
- addbanner and editbanner share a lot of javascript code, should put it in to a js file 
- DeliveryHandler.processBannerClicked: add code to trim string if its length is longer the maximum value in SQL
- Make sure in all pages, after disable button, then press Back in browser, the button are enabled   -> ok
- check fatalerror.jsp header (by compare with the file in mvnforum)   -> ok
- Change so that the i18n file in deployed context is WEB-INF\classes\i18n\mvnad\mvnad_i18n_en.properties 

- /adadmin/listzones : should support Order By   -> ok
- /adadmin/listbanners : should support Order By   -> ok
- Consider move jsp file into folder WEB-INF
- Test mvnAd on Oracle (setup and ThoNH will do the testing)
- /adadmin/addbannerofzone?ZoneID=58 : does not remember the bannerID in the combo box
- mvnad.admin.editzonesuccess.jsp.title = Update Zone: this key seem to be wrong    -----> OK
- Add Event Log to all tasks                                -----> OK

- Bug: Auto Reload could not go to target page with target="_self"

- Support Javascript checking in all page of Ads
   NOTE: do not add script directly, instead, use inc_js_checkvalid_myvietnamlib.jsp (so we do not need to add new i18n key)

- Can delete media even when it is used by some ads?
- In /listbanner, when filter by username -> action is not correct. --> ok
- ad: when add new banner, should default start date is today, end date is 1 month
- search for "ValidateForm" or "isBlank" for localize
 
[Tho]
- Test to make sure all input are validated by javascipt
- Make sure we cannot link more than xxx number of banner (check value of ZoneMaxBanner)

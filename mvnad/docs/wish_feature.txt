 
    * View of all campaigns or campaign slices
    * Dynamic and reliable ad view balancing
    * Injecting ads outside of a cycle without dirupting balanced views of other ads
    * Ability to allow advertisers to have accounts they can upload new ads to and buy credits (via PayPal, etc) and also check their own real-time stats
    * Admin approval of any uploaded or modified campaign
    * Rotation rules based on: date ranges, weighting, max views, max clicks, and site regions, plus editing of campaign mid-stream to adjust these parameters
    * Wide range of tracking statistics such as views, clicks, referral pages of clicks, geo-tracking, performance stats
    * Flexible HTML control (rich media but without giving up tracking statistics)
    * Preferably able to be called as a library or object. I can re-code an SSI system I suppose but I would prefer to call as a function because most pages I display are Perl-driven and will need to inject the ad into that output stream.

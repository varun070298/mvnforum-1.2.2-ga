You can use docbook on Linux or Window 

- I use a package at http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/dweiss/xml/projects/ant-docbook-styler/index.xml?lang=en
+ Download and unzip the styler to one directory.
+ Set DOCBOOK_HOME environment variable refer to that directory.
+ Change to that directory and run 
    ant -buildfile ant-build-docbook.xml
    
+ You must modify some files IN MVNFORUM

....
<xsl:import href="your_docbook_folder/xsl/html/docbook.xsl" />
....




// Modify 1 line in files : user.xml , install.xml, faq.xml.
Path point to file docbookx.dtd in your docbook directory as

  [
    <!ENTITY % global.entities SYSTEM "./include/global.xml">

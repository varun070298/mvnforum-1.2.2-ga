      <para>
        To test the database, mail support, indexing support and image processing support,
        click the Test System Configuration link on the Miscellaneous page or on the Admin Control Panel page.
        The following system parameters are tested. Below are a brief explanation on the significance of each
        and where to look to correct the problem.

      <title>Configure mvnForum</title>
      <para>New to mvnForum is the ability to configure the application setup using the online configuration interface. The minimal 
            setup must be completed first. Once the forum is running and you can access the Admin Control Panel, you can
            configure the remaining forum setup from the control panel. The minimal setup steps to get mvnForum running are
            presented in the <ulink url="install.html#install_system">installation</ulink>.</para>
      <para>The configuration menu, accessed from the Admin Control Panel, has the following main parts: backing up the configuration
           file; core forum configuration, which reflects the parameters found in mvnforum.xml; factory configuration for identifying the implementations of the
           major forum user authentication and http request processing; interface configuration for global standard
           user interface settings; and the core server configurations which reflect the parameters found in mvncore.xml</para>
      <para>Changes to the configuration information are not immediately put into place. As a matter of fact, most application parameters
           would not be noticed until the Servlet container is restarted. mvnForum provides a reload feature to force the application
           to reread the forum configuration. To force mvnForum to reread the configuration information, click the Reload all Changes link
           on the Admin's configuration menu. mvnForum will restart after reading all the parameters in the mvnforum.xml configuration 
           file; namely the majority of user-experience features.</para>

               forum accounts. Through the email activation, there is a human step involved in registering for forums (though there

        mvnForum provides a comprehensive set of search features that enable the user to find posts by author, post topic, and date.
        The search features are supported by Jakarta's Lucene project. Lucene builds an index configured by mvnForum
        which speeds user's searches of the forum content. To rebuild the index, click on the Rebuild Searching Index.

            Following these actions, you will have a new forum and a user that belongs to a group that can access and

            and group/user permissions to the forums.

    <title>Forum Management</title>
    <para>
      mvnForum follows a typical structure for grouping discussions into common interests. To manage these
      groups of discussions, an administrator can create, edit and delete forum categories and forums using the
      Forum Management control panel. Accessed from the forums administration control panel, the forum management
      interface shows the list of current categories and forums. Use the links provided to manage
      forum categories and forums.

      <title>Category</title>
      <para>
        Forum categories are top-level groups of forums. An administrator can create categories, add and remove
        forums from a category and remove categories. Also, once categories have been added to the list, administrators
        can change the order of the categories and add and remove forums within the categories. For forum management,

      Access to forums is managed through a combination of group and user permissions. A group is
      a role definition that provides access to a collection of forum user and administration actions.
      Users are assigned to groups to provide them access to these actions. Rather than manage individual
      group permissions, it is easier to manage permissions for a group and then assign users to one or more
      groups.

    <title>Permissions</title>
    <para>With release candidate 2 (RC2), mvnForum introduced a very granular permissions system for granting access to and
    restricting access from all aspects of the forum environment. Permissions are granted to groups and users based on
    sets of restriction rules (combined permissions) and individual permissions for specific functions such as deleting forums 
    and adding post threads.</para>
    <para>By default, new accounts are not granted any permissions except for those permissions provided by the group they
      belong to. Permissions are determined by combining the most permissive permission restrictions of a user's group and their
      individual permissions. Therefore, a user who belongs to the forum moderator group that has permissions to moderate the forum
      called 'thisForum' but does not have individual permission to moderate that forum will have permission to moderate the forum
      because of their participation in the group.</para>
    <para>In addition to the combination of the user and group permissions, mvnForum provides the ability to manage
      permissions for the entire forum site, global permissions, and for individual forums, forum permissions.</para>

        <para>To actively participate in a forum, users will want to establish accounts
          with the forum so that they can be notified of updates to a forum or a thread;
          so that they can customize their profile; and so that they can be credited
          with their participation.  To create a new user account, click on the
          New User link in the navigation bar near the top of the forum page.  Once you have
          clicked on this link, the forum loads a template for creating a new user account.</para>

        <para>mvnForum provides a common means to track updates to threads in a forum you have a particular interest or responses to posts you make.
          This means is called a watch.  A watch is the request to receive notifications (currently by email) of updates to posts or threads in
          a forum that you are interested in following.  Watches, also known as alerts, notifications and subscriptions, come in two common
          flavors: immediate notification and digested or summary reports; mvnForum currently supports the digested format.
          There are two ways to create watches; either in the Change Watches form
          or when replying to posts <link linkend="user_watches_post" endterm="user_watches_post.title"/>.
          To request watches, you must <link linkend="user_activate">activate your account</link> which ensure a valid email to send the
          watch notifications to.

      <title id="user_posting.title">Posting</title>
      <para>A post is a comment or question to post to a forum that should have some relationship to the topics represented
        in the forum.  Posts that do not adhere to the theme of the forum are considered 'off topic' and quite often
        posting off topic is considered taboo (and can be moderated, and may even result in being banned from the forum).

        <para>To start a discussion about a topic of interest or to respond to comments or questions posed in another thread,
          you create a post.  The first post in a thread defines the name of the thread.  Therefore, the topic of the first
          post in a thread should be descriptive enough to give participants in a forum enough of an idea what the question
          is or what your opinion is that they can decide whether to participate without having to access the post's body.

        <para>By default, a new post will present the text the user typed into the body section as plain text without any formatting.  The one
          exception to this is that carraige returns will be preserved and presented to readers as new lines.  To edit the format of posts,
          use the basic formatting tools provided in the 'normal' mode or the enchanged mode which adds the ability to nest formatting tags.

        <para>mvnForum supports at several ways to attach files to a thread or post.  The first
          is the ability to embed an image within the body of a post; the second is to attach
          a file, such as supporting documentation, to a post.  The process is slightly different
          for each method: including images make a reference to an image that must already be
          on the internet and accessible via a URL; attached files are uploaded to the forum server which 
          then relates the file(s) to the post.  Users can then access the files from within the post context.

             button in the top tool bar (scripting must be enabled for this to work - for most things
             in the forum to work). Enter the complete URL for the image and the image will be placed
             in the post when it is rendered.  The code you see is mvnforum code for storing the reference

             label depends on whether you are editing, creating or responding).  When the post has been submitted,
             the forum provides a link to <guilabel>Go to file attachment</guilabel>.  Click this link to access
             the file attachment form.   Either enter the path on the local or remote computer where the file
             is stored or click the Browse button to search for the file and optionally enter a 
             description for the file.  You can choose to attach more files by checking the

      <para>mvnForum users are able to perform activities in the forum environment
       based on the group(s) they belong to.  In addition to being able to manage
       forums and create threads, mvnForum will support limiting read and/or edit individual
       forums based on inclusion in a group.  Only site administrators can currently
       manage group membership.  See the administrator <ulink url="faq.html#admin_groups">group</ulink>

      <title id="moderate.title">Moderating</title>
      <para>Moderation is the process of auditing, sensoring, or guiding the direction of a conversation.
      Some forums have a very narrow purpose and want to make sure that all participants adhere to the 
      principals of the forum.  Other forums are intended for a young audience or want to keep their language
      clean.  These types of forums are good candidates for moderation.</para>
      <para>The following basic things are necessary to know about moderating forums
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>Setup a forum to be either post, thread or post and thread moderated</listitem>
          <listitem>Assign one or more moderators to the forum</listitem>
          <listitem>Posts or threads are either accepted or rejected by moderators; until a post/thread has 
            been accepted, it does not show up in the list of posts/threads.</listitem>
          <listitem>When a forum is set to moderate, every single post or thread (depending on how the
            forum was setup) must be accepted or rejected (called deleted in mvnForum).</listitem>
          <listitem>As of RC3, moderation consists only of accept/reject.  Another form of moderation
            allows for assigning various levels of appropriateness or rating threads and posts.  Also,
            an extension to the simple accept/reject moderation includes explanations for rejection which
            can be helpful to users trying to figure out why their posts are rejected.</listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>Users participating in a moderated forum make their posts just as they would in an unmoderated
         forum.  The difference being that in a moderated forum, they they will not see their posts presented
         on the site until they have been accepted by a moderator.</para>
      <para>The basic process for a moderated forum is:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>A user submits a post on the moderated forum</listitem>
          <listitem>A moderator reviews the list of pending threads and accepts or rejects each post or thread</listitem>
          <listitem>Once accepted, the post is presented on the forum</listitem>
          <listitem>Rejected posts are deleted from the database (?? is this true)</listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

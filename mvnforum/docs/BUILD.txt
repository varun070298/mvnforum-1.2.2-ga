BUILD INSTRUCTION
---------------------------------------------


To build mvnForum, either from the source package or from CVS, follow
the following steps:
Note: after building mvnForum, see the INSTALL.txt for the instruction
      to setup mvnForum on your Servlet Container.

1. Get the source code, if you have the source package, just extract
   it to a folder. If you don't have the source package or you would
   like to build the latest development source code, check out from
   CVS. See the CVS.txt for detailed information.

2. Download ant build tool from http://jakarta.apache.org, then config it
   (please see the document from the ant package)

3. Edit file mvnforum\build.properties to suit your need and/or environment

4. cd to folder mvnforum, then type ant:
   cd mvnforum
   ant

5. the mvnForum webapp is created in folder mvnforum/build/webapp


NOTE: If you are a developer, then config the build.properties
      and set the proper value for deploy.localhost . Then you could
      deploy to your servlet container with this command:

      ant deploy-localhost

NOTE: If you are a developer and want to extent mvnForum
      by replacing default mvnForum's files (such as your
      own mvnforum.xml, *.jsp files), please put these files
      in folder extension. See extension/README.txt for more
      information on how to extend mvnForum


The build process should be easy and without any error. If there is
not any error, Ant should print out BUILD SUCCESSFUL message.

We hope you will enjoy mvnForum :)

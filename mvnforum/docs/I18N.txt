* IMPORTANT: Please read the note below carefully before continuing any i18n tasks
****************************************************************************

Note for user:
--------------------
- If you found any issues in the current translation, please email
    the suggestion for the language maintainer (and CC to me) (found in i18n/*.properties)

- If your language has not been translated/localized, you could go
    ahead and translate it (I will very happy to help you and officially
    support your language in the next release of mvnForum). This will bring
    benefit to your language community and mvnForum community alike


Note for developers:
--------------------
- Please test daily mvnForum to know the current localization status in
  general and your language specifically.
  URL: http://mvnforum.linux.dk/

- Currently only user module in mvnForum has been localized.
    (Jsp admin module and .java later)

- All resource keys in ResourceBundle MUST begin with mvnforum and
    MUST NOT contain these three characters ':' (colon) , '=' (equal sign), ' ' (space)
    ex: mvnforum.common.forum


i18n TODO list
-----------------------------

- i18n and l10n all messages in the *.jsp files in the Admin Zone
    (maybe not in the near future)
- l10n to more and more languages (We need your help with this task)



Cheers!

*  DO NOT CONTINUE IF YOU HAVE NOT VISITED 2 ABOVE LINKS, OR YOU COULD ENTER TROUBLES  *
****************************************************************************************

****************************************************************************************
*  BEFORE CONTINUE, WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO BACKUP YOUR DATA AND DATABASE FIRST     *
****************************************************************************************


NOTE: This installation guide is for the mvnForum 1.2.x GA release

Install mvnForum is quite easy, just follow the below steps:
NOTE: This release supports 9 DBMS:
    MySQL, Oracle 8i/9i, Sql Server, DB2, postgreSQL, hsqldb, Interbase/Firebird, SAPDB and Sybase
    (If mvnForum doesn't support your database, you should be able to port it
    to other databases easily by using file sql/mvnForum_JDBC.sql as a template)

********************************************************************************
*  NOTE: To upgrade from beta1, beta2 ,beta3, rc1, rc2, rc3 or rc4, 1.0 GA, 1.1 GA release, READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY
*
*  1. Backup your database first.
*
*  2. Run the update sql script, please look at mvnforum\sql\upgrade
*
*  3. Backup your mvnForumHome folder, which contains a lot of important data
*
*  4. Backup your users' avatars in your App Server in this
*     folder: mvnplugin\mvnforum\upload\memberavatars
*     (The above folder is relative to the webapp dir of your App Server)
      (NOTE: this step is only for RC3 and before)
*
*  5. Back up all your config (.properties and/or .xml files) in your App Server in this
*     folder: WEB-INF\classes (Backup this is for reference only)
*     (The above folder is relative to the webapp dir of your App Server)
*
*  6. Back up your current servlet context folder. Then delete your current
*     servlet context of mvnForum before continuing the setup
*
*  7. In step 3 below, you MUST re-config your new mvncore.xml and mvnforum.xml files
*     (Note: The properties files has been changed to xml files since previous release, so you cannot reuse
*     the properties files in the beta1/beta2/beta3/rc1/rc2/rc3, rc4, 1.0 GA release)
*     Config the file log4j.properties for your logging (we highly recommend
*     you config you log file to the log folder in mvnForumHome)
*
*  8. After setting up successfully, restore the avartars that you
*     have backuped above.
*     NOTE: that begin with RC4, the avatar folder is
*           moved to folder mvnForumHome/memberavatars
*
*  9. Run and test if mvnForum can run properly, and confirm the mvnForumHome
*     has been configured properly
*
*  10. Delete all the index in folder mvnForumHome/search. Rebuild the Lucene index
*     for your forum before user can search on your forum:
*     Admin Index -> Miscellaneous Tasks -> Rebuild Lucene Search Index
*     NOTE: the post index has been changed from mvnForumHome/search
*           to mvnForumHome/search/post since RC4. If you are using RC4,
            you dont have to rebuild the index file.
*
*  If you have problem with the upgrade, just post message to
*  the box Installation and Upgrade at http://www.mvnForum.com
********************************************************************************


2. System requirements
---------------------------------------------------
- Any App Server SUPPORTS Jsp 1.2 and Servlet 2.3 (mvnForum WILL NOT
    run on Jsp 1.1/Servlet 2.2 Container such as Tomcat 3/ JRun 3)
  NOTE: mvnForum CANNOT run on Orion App Server because Orion does not
        fully support Jsp 1.2 and Servlet 2.3

- JDK 1.4 or later (Note that release 1.0 GA is the last release that support JDK 1.3)

- One of supported databases with a JDBC 2.0 compliant driver
  (this release includes 4 drivers: Connector/J, JTDS, postgreSQL and hsqldb)


3. Application Server Setup
---------------------------------------------------
NOTE: If you use JRun 4, JBoss and have problem with log4j, please remove log4j.jar from WEB-INF/lib

NOTE: If you use JRun 4 or Tomcat 5.x and have problem with log4j,
      please read logging configuration guide in the file WEB-INF/classes/commons-logging.properties

NOTE: If you use old version of Resin and you have error with the xml parser,
      you should delete file web.xml, and rename web.xml.resin to web.xml
      (Only need if you have problem with XML parser)

NOTE: If you use Resin, make sure you DELETE these 4 files in mvnForum package:
      (Not sure why Resin does not conform to Servlet standard)
      WEB-INF/lib/jstl.jar
      WEB-INF/lib/standard.jar
      WEB-INF/fmt.tld
      WEB-INF/fmt-rt.tld

NOTE: Your App Server SHOULD NOT be installed in a folder whose path name contains
      the space character. For example, "C:\Program Files" contains a space character
      and that can pose problems.

- Unzip the distribution zip file into a folder

- Create a context in your app server. In Tomcat, just create a dir
  (for example : mvnforum) in the tomcat/webapps. This dir (context)
  MUST be in lower case (such as mvnforum). Note that in some
  app server such as Web Logic, you MUST deploy the context, just create
  a context dir will not work.

  NOTE: If you already have a context, you can install mvnForum to your existed
        context, please note that folder WEB-INF must be the direct sub folder
        of your context. Then just merge the web.xml and mvnForum
        will run happily with your current app in the same context

- Create a home folder for mvnForum, which MUST NOT be accessible from
  the web (This folder could be in your WEB-INF folder, such as WEB-INF/mvnForumHome)
  This mvnForumHome folder IS VERY IMPORTANT, it is used to store the uploaded
  attachment, uploaded avatar, uploaded PM's attachment and the Lucene search index.
  mvnForum WILL NOT run if you did not configure it properly
  NOTE: if you do not use the default WEB-INF/mvnForumHome, then copy the content
        of folder WEB-INF/mvnForumHome to your new folder mvnForumHome. The reason
        is some default files such as email template are needed

- In the extracted folder, find the dir webapp/WEB-INF/classes,
  there are 2 xml files here (mvncore.xml and mvnforum.xml), open them in a text editor 
  and change the config parameters to appropriate values (the short guide in these files
  will help you config). You can also find the file log4j.properties,
  this file is for logging, so open and edit it to a proper value on your system.
  NOTE: Set database parameters to the correct values in the step 4 below
        The information for database configuration is in the comment header
        of the sql script. Ex: if you use MySql, please read the configuration
        parameter guide in sql/mvnForum_mysql.sql
  NOTE: Currently since RC4, you SHOULD restart your App Server if you make changes
        to properties or xml files (although you can reload the configuration
        in the Admin zone, not all parameters can be reloaded)

- Copy the content of webapp dir in the extracted folder to the context dir
  that you have created above.

  NOTE: Open and see picture at mvnforum\docs\images\webapp_structure.gif

        IMPORTANT: Please confirm you have correct directory structure
        as in the picture, if not, mvnForum will NOT run.

- If you dont need some language support, remove that locale in
      option <supported_locales> in file mvnforum.xml.

- You could change the default language with parameter <default_locale_name> in mvnforum.xml

- NOTE: since RC4, the localization is implemented by JSTL, so there are not
        many folders for each language as in RC3 and before.

- NOTE: On Oracle AS 10g:
        By default, The Oc4j library is loaded first then the local library load later
        That makes mvnforum does not work properly.. To work properly, 
        you should copy (you can find it in the OC4J_HOME/j2ee/home/application-deployments/default/your-app folder) 
        or create a file naming "orion-web.xml" into the "WEB-INF" folder
        
        web-orion.xml: remember the attribute: search-local-classes-first="true"

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE orion-web-app PUBLIC "-//ORACLE//DTD OC4J Web Application 9.04//EN" "http://xmlns.oracle.com/ias/dtds/orion-web-9_04.dtd">

<orion-web-app
    deployment-version="10.1.2.0.0"
    jsp-cache-directory="./persistence"
    jsp-cache-tlds="on"
    temporary-directory="./temp">
    <web-app-class-loader search-local-classes-first="true" include-war-manifest-class-path="true" />
    <security-role-mapping name="tomcat">
    </security-role-mapping>
</orion-web-app>

4. Database Setup
---------------------------------------------------
NOTE: If you upgrade from beta1/beta2/beta3/rc1,rc2,rc3,rc4,1.0 GA you have to upgrade your database schema.
      Run the upgrade sql script at mvnforum\sql\upgrade.

NOTE: Before running the script, we highly recommend that you back up all your data.

NOTE: There are notes/guides/database configuration for specific database in the header of specific
      sql script file (sql/mvnForum_<database>.sql). You are highly recommended
      to read all the notes carefully, because it may help you avoid wasted time and
      possible database-specific problems

NOTE: If you use MySql 4.1.x or 5.0.x, please see help at
      http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/connector-j-installing-upgrading.html

The below database setup is for NEW INSTALLATION ONLY:

- In the extracted folder, find the file sql/mvnForum_<database>.sql
  (<database> is the database you would like to setup)

- Create a database and confirm the correct database params that have been set
  in the step 3 above

- Run the sql script. Please see your database document for detail on how to run a sql script

- Copy the JDBC driver for your database to the WEB-INF/lib folder of your context
  in step 3 above. (Note that this release includes 4 drivers for MySQL, Sql Server, postgreSQL and hsqldb)

NOTE: mvnForum includes an embeded database for hsqldb in folder sql/hsqldb, so you can
      copy this folder (hsqldb) to your mvnForumHome and config the file
      mvncore.xml (that is, just copy and dont need to run the hsqldb script).
      This is the fastest way to use mvnForum.
      Read the short guide in /sql/mvnForum_hsqldb.sql for detailed hsqldb configuration guide.
      

5. Setup Admin tool
---------------------------------------------------
There are 2 links by default:
If you install in a context other than ROOT context, the url looks like this:
http://www.[yourserver].com/[yourcontext]/mvnforum/index : home for mvnForum
http://www.[yourserver].com/[yourcontext]/mvnforumadmin/index : Admin Zone

If you install in the ROOT context, the url look likes this:
http://www.[yourserver].com/mvnforum/index : home for mvnForum
http://www.[yourserver].com/mvnforumadmin/index : Admin Zone

- Go to the Admin Zone and enter username = admin and password = admin

- If Login successfully, click a Test System Configuration to check the config
  (If you deploy on a Linux/Unix box, Image Processing might not been supported)

- The index page you see when you login also give you other info, including
  database and system info

- Change the password and edit your profile by clicking Forum Index -> MyProfile

- Click Forum Management to create categories/forums for your community

- You can create new users and set permissions for these new users

- Please spend time to read the mvnForum's documentation and FAQ
  at  http://www.[yourserver].com/[yourcontext]/mvnforum/help
  or access the latest version at:
  http://www.mvnforum.com/mvnforum/help (you are highly recommended to read this Help link)

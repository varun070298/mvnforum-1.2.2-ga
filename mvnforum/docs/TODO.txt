- In listpolls, should have icon to show the status of the poll

XuanTL
- Review the parameter check in the album feature
- AlbumWebHandler.prepareViewPublicAlbum()
    the approach to update viewcount seem not good, need to review this carefully
- Some page, such as viewpublicalbumitemx still use method showDialog or showWindow
    we should use the same method in myvietnam.js
- ImageIO.read() could return null: check on what condition it is null, and what error should we show to user
- Currently many page does not support Enter key when entering current password
    Guide: search for name="MemberCurrentMatkhau"
    Add checkEnter
    make sure the form has  onsubmit="return false;"
    Test on IE (ask ThoNH for testing)
- ContentAlbumUtil should be a util class (final class and have private constructor)
- When delete member, also delete all album of that member
- Review code AlbumWebHandler.prepareDeleteAlbum()
    see my comment in this method
- Implement CAS check current password on into enterprise edition 
- When enable activation, if user change email, we should show a message as when he register for an account
- listpendingusers: when click Do Action, we should disable the button
- listattachments: support viewpost to view the post that contain the attachment
- change the photoleft.gif to no_album_avatar.gif
- in user area, when send email, should check for captcha
- Search ALL project for jsp file that have table with border="0", change to class="noborder"
- condition in jsp file to show priority icon should be put into MyUtil
- Implement thread rating
- Implement social book mark (as in liferay)
- Test this forum: http://sourceforge.net/projects/nemesis-forum/
- meta.jsp 
    should have a different meta.jsp for enterprise version
    update the build.xml file
    
- Add method: OnlineUser.getShortcutIconPath();
- Filter subject with \r\n and %0a and %0d
    Test%0a%0dFrom: <root@somewhere.com>
- Test jspwiki with https
- Register with existed username, show error:
  Alternate key already exists. Cannot create new Member with the same [MemberName] (ckkampy).
  should check username first, if exists, show a friendly message (also do the same for email)  
- Alternate key already exists. Cannot create new Member with the same [MemberEmail] (tranthanh0302@yahoo.com).
   ==> we should tell a more friendly message when email and username is already existed
- Add event log when delete post or thread (the desc should have info of threadid, author of the thread, title of thread)
- viewpublicalbumitem : should have option to select the size of the photo (Original, max width, max height)
- Watch email does not work now
- Review code: processUploadAlbumAvatar()
- upload small album avatar, it zoom the picture to 160x160
- Not consistent behaviour:
    http://localhost:8080/mvnforum_enterprise/mvnforum/viewalbum?albumid=5&check=true
    http://localhost:8080/mvnforum_enterprise/mvnforum/myprofile
    ==>> NotLoginException should have a error that say "Sorry, you must login first."
- slideshow does not jump if the image in disk is missing
- should only have 1 whirly cache xml file in we should put it in the module myvietnam/properties
- Consider config module pattern in the web.xml (as a param of Servlet)
- Chay che do activation, sau khi change email hoan toan khong thong bao cho user biet can phai kich hoat lai
- "Hien tai ban khong xem luong nay"  =>> Hien tai ban khong dang ky nhan mail luong nay
- consider "luong" ==> chu de (for Vietnamese)
- Add in the header near Moderation, show the number of posts that need to moderate 
    (consider cache for better performance)
- View Event Log: should have a combo box to filter by username (MemberName)
- listthreads?forum=3 : title should include the forum name
- mvncore.xml check this key <default_mail_from>: what code use this key ?
- MVNForumConfig.getDefaultCateogryID() <default_category_id> : should review this method, 
    and should we create a new key default_category_id_for_private_forums in mvnforum_enterprise.xml ?
- fix bug when listonlineusers
    Cannot get description because action is null
- searchalbumitem : missing vietnamse keyboard 
    (think about the place to put the VN keyboard, currently cannot enter VNese into search textbox)

- save album item caption: when click Save, should disable the button -> OK
- Album: implement album view count, album item view count, show album item rate (image from youtube.com) -> OK
- AlbumItemDAO.java     public int getTagCount(String itemTag) --> OK (use "LIKE %____%" ??)
- When delete album, we should write a new method to delete album in Lucene index (similar to delete thread, we delete all the posts in it) --> OK
- Cannot upload. Detailed reason: the request was rejected because its size (5496003) exceeds the configured maximum (1048576)  -> OK
- Cannot upload album item(s) because the width or height of this item is so big.  -> OK
    should show the size if picture and the maximum size
    NOTE: common upload only check for size of total, not each size, therefore, we should re-write code as follow:
    - maxSize is the remained size
    - when for each FileItem, check for maxAlbumItemSize

- Automatically deleting threads by age. (viewthread_thread,4167)
- RankDAO still use m_dirty
- Support Guest enable/disable, setting time zone, signature, name, option, ...
- It would be nice if mvnForum would check the browser for people who were not
  logged in and then use the preference if people set one in their profile.

- Check keys should support the encoding
- Check orphan Post:

  FROM mvnforumPost LEFT JOIN mvnforumThread
  ON mvnforumPost.ThreadID = mvnforumThread.ThreadID
  WHERE mvnforumThread.threadID IS NULL

- Research the login mechanism of RSS and ATOM
- Allow login for the first time with the login information in the request
- Sort By in Favorite Threads
- localize changepassword in Admin zone
- Do not filter emoticon if enable_emoticon = false
- The color of quota usage should be in the css
- Currently, when update new message, only check in the INBOX
- RSS: have option to get the rowsToReturn and bytesToReturn

- MVNForumConfig.ENABLE_AUTO_FORUM_OWNER = false
- New permission: can AdminUser: view online status, usermanagement
- I dont like the ability to post pictures.. I hope it's optional.
        Think the generic solution (limit some mime types)
- Oracle cannot send mail to Tester
- Change default behavior to search substring
  (thread=2660)
- mvnforumMember : MemberPassword VARCHAR(200) : need test on DB2, Firebird,
                   database not support: postgreSql 7.x (8.x is okie), hsqldb



TODO List: things must be done for version 1.3 and later
------------------------------------------------------
- [TOP PRIORITY] Fix all known bugs
- [TOP PRIORITY] Add a web setup tool
- [TOP PRIORITY] Need a XML/database schema to store all config
- Email alert when have unanswered thread for more than x days (Forum Intecetor feature)
- Preview attachment image, patch by Serobit (thread=3270)
- Option to kick off user
- Noisy thread/post option
- a button on the register page to check the availability of the account name
- Support enable PM_statistics
- Option to run in Google like invitation mode
- Allow/Deny list for moderation
- Option to allow Admin to leave message when turn off forum
- Watch management, allow admin can view, delete watch of any user
- Max number of attachments (thread=2866)
- Show user Level determination by provide parameter to config the class name
- Since a user may have many posting in one thread, in the results being return,
  should we collapse the all posting within one thread.
  (http://www.mvnforum.com/mvnforum/viewthread?thread=1316)
- I'd much prefer to use the standard java timezones (Australia/Sydney, America/Los Angeles -
    see the java.util.TimeZone.getTimeZone() method). This is important for daylight saving issues
    (thread=2646)
- 1) A list of related threads together with each thread, so it is possible to add
  the references mentioned above and they can be displayed in a structured way that
  does not cost the "on-screen overhead"
  (thread=2303)
  2) for each thread, there could be a list (similar to the one of similar threads)
  repeating all hyperlinks used in the posts.
  3) 3. similar to 1. and 2.: list of attachments for each thread

- Point and Level, like a RPG game (thread=2626)
- Improve the issue of nest of mvnCode
- Parse [..] and [/...] to lowercase when saving the post to the database
  (regular expression with option ig). The actual parsing off the UBB codes
  can than still be done before displaying the post. In this case all the
  UBB-codes are saved in lowercase in the database.
  (thread=893)

- Can't use arrays in a code block? (thread=824)

- Database update:
  * mvnforumForum  : forumModerationEmails

- Send mail to original author when move the thread

- this feature will be very userfull when a user doesn't set a watch for a thread and a moderator
    move the thread in another forum. If the user found a link from the original forum it's easy looking for the thread.
    (thread=1832)

- new Config param: LoginMode: Normal/NoLoginWithSameID/KickoutSameID
- Scan the attachment
- Delete users even there are posts from this user
- Escape string in xml

- Add a JSTL tag to escape the email (and begin to build MyVietnam JSTL lib)

- It would be nice if the tag could be interpreted in the list as well,
  but if this is difficult (because the close tag isn't there) perhaps
  it could just be stripped out of the list text.
  (thread=1518)

- Email thread to friend

- I would suggest looking at securityfilter on sourceforge.
  It is a portable implementation of web container security with
  specific support for Tomcat. It also contains an easily extendable realm mechanism.
  (thread=899)

- Total review of the css (style sheet)
- Fix memory problem in attachment download
  Problem: currently load attach file to memory, may cause OutOfMemoryException
  Reason: I don't know what to do if some user are download attachment
          and the Moderator delete the attachment
  Sollution: make some test about concurrent read and delete
             Tomcat has a servlet called DefaultServlet, which serve the static file
             so we could refer and learn how to solve our problem
  Igor suggestion: see methods in ExportWebHandler getExportXmlZip() and sendToUser()
- Search : show the relevance value
- Have a link to send Watch Mail immediately in Admin Zone
- Search : stop word all mvnCode
- Migration from Jive version 2.6 and later

- Being able to collapse threads/sections could simplify navigation in certain cases,
  at least from my standpoint. This whether it was only the thread with subsequent replies,
  or hierarchically, that is level by level in the thread.

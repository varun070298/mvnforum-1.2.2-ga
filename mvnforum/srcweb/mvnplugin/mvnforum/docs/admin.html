      The Administration Guide provides an introduction to setting up your first online forum
      and the proper use of the forum administration tools. If you do not see what you are looking for
      here, take a look at the <a href="faq.html" target="_top">FAQ section</a>,

            setup must be completed first. Once the forum is running and you can access the Admin Control Panel, you can
            configure the remaining forum setup from the control panel. The minimal setup steps to get mvnForum running are
            presented in the <a href="install.html#install_system" target="_top">installation</a>.</p><p>The configuration menu, accessed from the Admin Control Panel, has the following main parts: backing up the configuration
           file; core forum configuration, which reflects the parameters found in mvnforum.xml; factory configuration for identifying the implementations of the
           major forum user authentication and http request processing; interface configuration for global standard
           user interface settings; and the core server configurations which reflect the parameters found in mvncore.xml</p><p>Changes to the configuration information are not immediately put into place. As a matter of fact, most application parameters
           would not be noticed until the Servlet container is restarted. mvnForum provides a reload feature to force the application
           to reread the forum configuration. To force mvnForum to reread the configuration information, click the Reload all Changes link
           on the Admin's configuration menu. mvnForum will restart after reading all the parameters in the mvnforum.xml configuration

        mvnForum provides a comprehensive set of search features that enable the user to find posts by author, post topic, and date.
        The search features are supported by Jakarta's Lucene project. Lucene builds an index configured by mvnForum
        which speeds user's searches of the forum content. To rebuild the index, click on the Rebuild Searching Index.
      </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e347"></a>Overview</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
      To get started with mvnForum, you should understand these basic issues.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><p class="title"><b>Getting started with forum administration</b></p><ul type="disc"><li><p>The hierarchy of the forums is categories to forums to threads (or posts). Threads belong to a single forum and forums belong to a single category.</p></li><li><p>Guests can access forum threads for reading and searching only</p></li><li><p>Access to forums is restricted based on group and user permissions.</p></li><li><p>
            Given that, here is a typical setup process for creating a new forum
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>Create a new Group, called newGroup</p></li><li><p>Set the global group permissions for the group so members of the group can login, and perform other tasks</p></li><li><p>Create a new User, called newGroupUser</p></li><li><p>Set the newGroupUser as the owner of the group, newGroup (this also adds the user newGroupUser as a member of this group)</p></li><li><p>Create a new category for the forum, called newCategory</p></li><li><p>Create a new forum, newForum, in the newCategory category</p></li><li><p>Set the forum-specific group permissions of the newGroup so they can moderate the forum</p></li></ul></div><p>
            Following these actions, you will have a new forum and a user that belongs to a group that can access and
            moderate all threads in the new forum. mvnForum has a very granular approach to managing forums
            and group/user permissions to the forums.
          </p></li><li><p></p></li></ul></div><p>
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e393"></a>Forum Management</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
      mvnForum follows a typical structure for grouping discussions into common interests. To manage these
      groups of discussions, an administrator can create, edit and delete forum categories and forums using the
      Forum Management control panel. Accessed from the forums administration control panel, the forum management
      interface shows the list of current categories and forums. Use the links provided to manage
      forum categories and forums.
    </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="admin_category"></a>Category</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
        Forum categories are top-level groups of forums. An administrator can create categories, add and remove
        forums from a category and remove categories. Also, once categories have been added to the list, administrators
        can change the order of the categories and add and remove forums within the categories. For forum management,
        see  the <a href="#admin_forum" title="Forum">Forum</a> section.
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Add Category - click on the Add new Category link near the top of the page to load the
            category creation screen. A category has a name and a description. Use a short enough
            description to give forum users a concise understanding of the types of forums they will expect to find
            in the category.</p></li><li><p>Edit Category - click on the edit icon (<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="figure/edit.gif" alt="Edit icon"></span>)
            on the right side of the row of the forum you want to edit to navigate to the category
            edit screen. Change the description of the category or the category sort order.</p></li><li><p>Delete Category - Because of the danger of removing categories, the web interface only allows
            deleting empty categories. To delete a category, first delete all the <a href="#admin_forum" title="Forum">forums</a>.</p></li></ul></div><p>
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="admin_forum"></a>Forum</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
        Forums are groups of topics sharing a common thread or subject. The forum is the common meeting place for people
        to share ideas and ask questions on topics where they can expect to receive answers from people sharing interests
        and knowledge on the topics in the forum. To administer the list of forums supported by your site, navigate to
        the Forum Management interface accessed in the administrator control panel.

      Access to forums is managed through a combination of group and user permissions. A group is
      a role definition that provides access to a collection of forum user and administration actions.
      Users are assigned to groups to provide them access to these actions. Rather than manage individual
      group permissions, it is easier to manage permissions for a group and then assign users to one or more
      groups.

        The default groups installed with mvnForum are typically sufficient for most people to provide
        access rights and restrictions to the forum areas and actions. Some forum administrators may want to
        provide a more granular environment in which certain groups of people are limited to specific
        forums, forum moderators can only moderate certain forums (to provide both moderated and unmoderated forums),
        and certain users can only add or edit posts in certain forums.

    restricting access from all aspects of the forum environment. Permissions are granted to groups and users based on
    sets of restriction rules (combined permissions) and individual permissions for specific functions such as deleting forums 
    and adding post threads.</p><p>By default, new accounts are not granted any permissions except for those permissions provided by the group they
      belong to. Permissions are determined by combining the most permissive permission restrictions of a user's group and their
      individual permissions. Therefore, a user who belongs to the forum moderator group that has permissions to moderate the forum
      called 'thisForum' but does not have individual permission to moderate that forum will have permission to moderate the forum
      because of their participation in the group.</p><p>In addition to the combination of the user and group permissions, mvnForum provides the ability to manage
      permissions for the entire forum site, global permissions, and for individual forums, forum permissions.</p><p>The following sections describe the two classes of permissions, combined permissions and individual permissions.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="permissions_combined"></a>Combined Permissions</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
        As the name implies, combined permissions are group logical sets of permissions into more easily managed
        categories. The following describes the permission combinations and the individual permissions they group. Depending
        on whether you are managing <a href="#group_permissions_global">group global permissions</a>,
        <a href="#group_permissions_forum">group forum permissions</a>, <a href="#user_permissions_global">user global permissions</a>,
        or <a href="#user_permissions_forum">user forum permissions</a>, the exact result of setting the permissions will differ.

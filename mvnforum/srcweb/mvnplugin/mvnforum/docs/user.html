          This means is called a watch.  A watch is the request to receive notifications (currently by email) of updates to posts or threads in
          a forum that you are interested in following.  Watches, also known as alerts, notifications and subscriptions, come in two common
          flavors: immediate notification and digested or summary reports; mvnForum currently supports the digested format.
          There are two ways to create watches; either in the Change Watches form
          or when replying to posts <a href="#user_watches_post" title="Following Posts (watches)">Following Posts (watches)</a>.
          To request watches, you must <a href="#user_activate" title="Activate Account">activate your account</a> which ensure a valid email to send the
          watch notifications to.

          is the ability to embed an image within the body of a post; the second is to attach
          a file, such as supporting documentation, to a post.  The process is slightly different
          for each method: including images make a reference to an image that must already be
          on the internet and accessible via a URL; attached files are uploaded to the forum server which 
          then relates the file(s) to the post.  Users can then access the files from within the post context.
        </p><p>
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>Add an image - while creating/editing a post, click the <span class="guibutton">Image</span>
             button in the top tool bar (scripting must be enabled for this to work - for most things
             in the forum to work). Enter the complete URL for the image and the image will be placed
             in the post when it is rendered.  The code you see is mvnforum code for storing the reference
             in a database - it should not look like valid HTML.  
             </li><li>Attach a file - while creating/editing a post, check the <span class="guilabel">I would like to attach more files</span>
             check box and commit the post by clicking the submit button at the bottom of the form (the button
             label depends on whether you are editing, creating or responding).  When the post has been submitted,
             the forum provides a link to <span class="guilabel">Go to file attachment</span>.  Click this link to access
             the file attachment form.   Either enter the path on the local or remote computer where the file
             is stored or click the Browse button to search for the file and optionally enter a 
             description for the file.  You can choose to attach more files by checking the
             <span class="guilabel">I would like to attach more files</span> again at the bottom.</li></ul></div><p>
          n.b. To attach files, you must have file attachment permissions; members of the Power User group 
          and above have this permission and it can be set by selecting the Add Attach permission.

      Some forums have a very narrow purpose and want to make sure that all participants adhere to the 
      principals of the forum.  Other forums are intended for a young audience or want to keep their language
      clean.  These types of forums are good candidates for moderation.</p><p>The following basic things are necessary to know about moderating forums
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>Setup a forum to be either post, thread or post and thread moderated</li><li>Assign one or more moderators to the forum</li><li>Posts or threads are either accepted or rejected by moderators; until a post/thread has 
            been accepted, it does not show up in the list of posts/threads.</li><li>When a forum is set to moderate, every single post or thread (depending on how the
            forum was setup) must be accepted or rejected (called deleted in mvnForum).</li><li>As of RC3, moderation consists only of accept/reject.  Another form of moderation
            allows for assigning various levels of appropriateness or rating threads and posts.  Also,
            an extension to the simple accept/reject moderation includes explanations for rejection which
            can be helpful to users trying to figure out why their posts are rejected.</li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>Users participating in a moderated forum make their posts just as they would in an unmoderated
         forum.  The difference being that in a moderated forum, they they will not see their posts presented
         on the site until they have been accepted by a moderator.</p><p>The basic process for a moderated forum is:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>A user submits a post on the moderated forum</li><li>A moderator reviews the list of pending threads and accepts or rejects each post or thread</li><li>Once accepted, the post is presented on the forum</li><li>Rejected posts are deleted from the database (?? is this true)</li></ul></div><p>

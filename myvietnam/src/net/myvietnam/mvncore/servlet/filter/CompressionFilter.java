        Currently, many browsers do not send character encoding information in the
        Content-Type header of an HTTP request. If an encoding has not been specified
        by the client request, the container uses a default encoding to parse request
        parameters. If the client hasn't set character encoding and the request parameters
        are encoded with a different encoding than the default, the parameters will be
        parsed incorrectly. You can use the method setCharacterEncoding in ServletRequest
        interface to set the encoding. Since this method must be called
        prior to parsing any post data or reading any input from the request, this function
        is a prime application for filters(http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/Filters.pdf.)
        In this case, it may be caused by parsing parameter "gzip". And charset should be UTF-8.
        You can use another filter for the encoding.(see Tomcat's examples)
